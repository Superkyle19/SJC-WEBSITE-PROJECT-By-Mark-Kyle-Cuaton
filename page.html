<h2>The Founding Years</h2>
</center>
<center>
<p>
    Saint Joseph College was founded on February 20, 1928 by 
 <b>His Excellency Most Reverend Sofronio G. Hacbang, D.D.</b>(1887-1937) Bishop of Calbayog Diocese to which the whole of Samar and Leyte canonically belonged. 
 It was first named Instituto de San Jose. Its primary purpose was to offer Catholic education through which the Church could fulfill its work of evangelization.
 In June 1928, the school welcomed its first elementary and secondary students whose classes were held in a provisional school building made of light materials. Two years after, the school got recognition from the government for the said courses.
 <br> The Founder-Bishop entrusted the leadership of the school to the diocesan priests assigned as parish priest of the Parish of Our Lady of the Assumption, 
 Maasin. The first School Director was Reverend Father Sofio Mandia who came to Maasin as parish priest in 1931.
 <br> <h3>From Instituto to College</h3>
 The year Bishop Hacbang died, a new diocese was created in 1937 – the Diocese of Palo covering the whole island of Leyte. 
 The Instituto then was under the watchful eye of the new Bishop of Palo, Most Rev. Manuel M. Mascariñas, D.D. This time the Instituto progressed rapidly under the steering hands of Fr. Sofio Mandia. The increase of enrolment required new buildings. 
 To answer the need of those who craved for higher education but who could not proceed elsewhere due to financial constraints, the school offered the Junior Normal College Course in 1940.
 The outbreak of World War II interrupted classes from December 1941 to December 1944. When classes reopend in January, 1945, the Diocese of Palo asked the Benedictine Sisters to take over the administration of the school, marking the new epoch in the intellectual life of the Instituto. 
 With Sister Godfrieda Baumeister, OSB as the Directress, the school progressed by leaps and bounds. New school buildings were constructed and facilities were improved to accommodate more students. In 1947, the government recognized the Junior Normal College Course, which paved the way to rename the school Saint Joseph Junior College. 
 In 1949, Two-Year Preparatory Law and Third and Fourth Year of the Education Course were recognized by the state. Thus, in the later part of the year 1949 the Instituto de San Jose became Saint Joseph College after twenty-one years of existence.
 From then on, the new college offered other collegiate courses to students. The government recognized the following: the complete Bachelor of Science in Education (BSE) and Two-Year General Liberal Arts Course in 1950; Two-Year Junior Normal Course in 1954; 
 the One-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1956; Two-Year Collegiate Commercial Course in 1958; Third-Year of the Four Year Collegiate Commercial Course and Third and Fourth Years of the Four-Year Liberal Arts Course (AB-General) in 1959; Third and Fourth Years of the Preparatory Law Course (AB-Pre Law) in 1960; 
 Two-Year Collegiate Secretarial Course in 1961; Two-Year Special Vocational Secretarial Course in 1962; and Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Normal Course (BSEED) in 1965.
 <br> <h3>The Quest for Quality and Excellence</h3>
 On August 14, 1968, the new Diocese of Maasin was created by Blessed Pope Paul VI covering the whole newly created Province of Southern Leyte and extending to six municipalities of Leyte. 
 The school’s supervision then was transferred from the Diocese of Palo to the Diocese of Maasin whose first Bishop was the Most Rev. Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D. (1929-1997).
 In 1972, the Benedictine Sisters turned over the school administration to the Diocese of Maasin. The Lay Administration was headed by the President with Mr. Marcelino Hanopol Jr. 
 as the first President. Serving as the advisory and policy-making body was the Board of Trustees with the Bishop of Maasin as the Chairman. The Lay Administration has taken over where the Benedictines left. 
 It has continued the impetus for progress blazed by the past administrations, so that in the relatively short period of six years it has etched an indelible mark in the history of the school as it opened more courses and drove for quality and excellence: 
 Third and Fourth Years of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1973; The Night Secondary Course, One Year Course in Electronic Serviceman for Radio Receivers, Practical Electricity Course, Auto Mechanics Course, Civil Engineering Course, Preparatory Law Course, 
 and Third and Fourth year of the Collegiate Commercial Course in 1974.
 In 1978, the Bishop of Maasin, Most Rev.Vicente T. Ataviado, D.D., took over the Presidency of the school besides being the Chairman of the Board. In administering the school, he was assisted by Three Vice-Presidents-a Vice-President for Academics, a Vice-President for Finance and a Vice-President for General Services.

In 1979, the Sisters of Saint Francis of Perpetual Adoration (OSF) started working for the school upon the request of the Bishop of Maasin. The religious sisters served as administrators, teachers and campus ministers. In the same year, 
 an additional school site at Mambajao, Maasin, was developed where the building for the Engineering department and part of the High School department was constructed. The new campus provided vast open space for various school and diocesan activities.
 In the later part of 1981, the school had a new organizational set-up which was headed by the President assisted by the Presidential TROIKA instead of the three Vice-Presidents. It was during this time that the government fully recognized the five year course in Civil Engineering (BSCE) in 1985, Master of Arts in Education (MAED) in 1988, Four Year Course in Accountancy (BSA) in 1991, Associate in Computer Science (ACS) in 1994, and Associate in Computer Secretarial in 1995.
In 1995, Bishop Ataviado retired as School President and appointed Sister M. Anthony Kuizon, OSF to head the school. Under the new organizational set-up, the President was assisted by the Vice-President and the members of the Administrative and Academic Councils.
 Starting to rise also this time were the new grade school and the new college buildings to accommodate students of the newly offered courses which included in 1996 Master of Business Administration (MBA), Bachelor of Science in Computer Science (BSCS), Bachelor of Science in Secretarial Administration (BSSA), 
 and two years later Bachelor of Science in Criminology (BSCrim).
